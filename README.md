# PH526x_Harvard_Using-Python-for-Research

My homework and study exercises for the Using Python for Research course by Harvard on EDX.org

Course Instructor: Jukka-Pekka "JP" Onnela

Syllabus
  Course Description
  This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn about tools commonly used in research settings.

  Using a combination of a guided introduction and more independent in-depth exploration, you will get to practice your new Python skills with various case studies chosen for their scientific breadth and their coverage of different Python features.

  What you'll learn
  Python 3 programming basics (a review)
  Python tools for research applications (e.g., NumPy and SciPy modules) 
  How to apply Python research tools in practical settings
